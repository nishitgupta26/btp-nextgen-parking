# Next Generation Smart Parking Solution

Our solution, built using the MERN stack and Tailwind CSS, aims to solve two major real-life problems:

1. **Allow online and advanced booking of parking spaces**: This ensures that when you are going to any place, you do not worry about parking your vehicle.
2. **Increase the visibility of parking lots**: This results in profit maximization for parking lot owners.

Customers need to provide their location access to us, and we will show the nearby available parking lots sorted by nearest distance. To book a parking space online, users must first log in to our website, choose the desired parking lot, and book their parking.
